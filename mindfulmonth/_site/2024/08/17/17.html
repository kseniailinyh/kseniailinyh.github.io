<h2 id="clean-up-the-workplace">Clean up the workplace</h2>

<p>For the next four days, we will be tidying up and continuing to get rid of unnecessary items.</p>

<p>You see everything that surrounds you. Even when you’re not looking directly at an object and it’s just in your field of vision, you still see it. Then it becomes a reason for shifting your attention, for example, from a work task to thoughts about buying new headphones. Or about how it’s time for a cup of tea. Or about how it’s time for a vacation. That’s how the brain works. A “clean” desk helps you avoid distractions and use less mental fuel.</p>

<p>Remove items that are not necessary for work:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Take used sheets of paper to be recycled or throw them in the bin;</li>
  <li>Take dirty mugs to the kitchen;</li>
  <li>Throw away or put away in a drawer the remaining items.</li>
</ul>

<p>Keep only what you need within reach: a notebook and pen for notes, a bottle or glass of water. Everything is good in moderation, so keep a family photo.</p>
