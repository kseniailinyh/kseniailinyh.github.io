    <h2>Initiative</h2>
    <p>While there wasn&#39;t an established process for reviewing support cases in our company, I took the initiative to dive into them myself. I discovered a significant number of cases related to blocked accounts. Intrigued, I decided to investigate the login form&#39;s functionality.</p>

    <h2>The Issues</h2>
    <p>It turned out the login form was poorly designed:</p>
    <img src="login-form/login-form-01.png" alt="Issue 1 with initial login form">
    <img src="login-form/login-form-02.png" alt="Issue 2 with initial login form">
    <img src="login-form/login-form-03.png" alt="Issue 3 with initial login form">
    
    <ul>
      <li>It didn&#39;t warn users about account blocking after several failed attempts.</li>
      <li>The form didn’t notify users when they were blocked; it only notifies users about blocking if they typed the correct password.</li>
      <li>The blocking lasts for 15 minutes, but the form didn’t warn users about it.</li>
      <li>The form didn’t allow password resets if the account was blocked.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>These issues explained the high number of support requests. Moreover, there were error messages in different styles and with unclear wording.</p>

    <h2>Solution</h2>
    <p>While tempted to redesign the entire form, I realized that small, targeted changes would be more efficient and quicker for the development team to implement.</p>

    <p>I prioritized these changes based on their potential impact, drawing from my experience, and presented them to stakeholders.</p>

    <p>The project was approved and is currently in development.</p>

    <h2>Project Status</h2>
    <p>Although I can&#39;t show metrics yet, I plan to use the support case numbers as a baseline post-release. My hypothesis is that these small changes will reduce support requests, ultimately benefiting our users.</p>
