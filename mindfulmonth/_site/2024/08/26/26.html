<h2 id="remember-to-whom-and-for-what-you-are-grateful">Remember to whom and for what you are grateful</h2>

<p>Gratitude is a simple way to be happy.</p>

<p>Choose a time for this practice. The time of day isn’t very important, but it is important that nothing distracts you—this practice requires a few minutes of reflection. For example, it’s convenient to do this in the evening, at home. It will be even better if you do it in writing.</p>

<p>Sit down and ask yourself “Who am I grateful to?”</p>

<p>Perhaps someone close to you will come to mind, or just a stranger who was kind to you once. Or it could be a colleague who taught you something.</p>

<p>Or ask yourself “What am I grateful for?”</p>

<p>You can feel gratitude simply for something regardless of other people. For example, you can be grateful just for being alive and relatively healthy, not hungry, having a place to live, and having an interesting job. There are many reasons to experience a feeling of gratitude.</p>

<p>In difficult moments, it may seem that everything is bad and nothing is working out. This is because your focus is strongly shifted towards immediate problems. The practice of gratitude helps to dispel this illusion and see what you didn’t notice before.</p>

<p>Regular practice of gratitude can seriously change your perception of life. It’s impossible to be grateful and dissatisfied at the same time.</p>
