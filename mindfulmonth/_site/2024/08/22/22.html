<h2 id="go-to-bed-an-hour-earlier">Go to bed an hour earlier</h2>

<p>Sleep greatly affects how we feel. To feel good, we need to get enough sleep.</p>

<p>Set a goal for today — go to bed an hour earlier. To make it happen, allocate time for your evening routine — half an hour or an hour — and set a reminder for this time so you can start preparing for bed on time.</p>

<p>Perhaps you’ve been dreaming of getting enough sleep for a long time, and every morning is difficult for you. Today is the day when you can fulfill the promise you made to yourself.</p>

<p>To improve your sleep, try these techniques:</p>

<h3 id="dont-use-your-phone-or-tablet-for-an-hour-before-bed">Don’t use your phone or tablet for an hour before bed</h3>

<p>Light, especially bright and cold, interferes with the body’s production of melatonin — the sleep hormone. Because of this, it’s harder for you to fall asleep, and your sleep is less deep and restorative than it could be.</p>

<p>If you regularly work on a computer before bed, install the F.lux program — it will adjust the screen’s light temperature according to the time of day. This feature is already built into macOS and iOS.</p>

<h3 id="air-out-and-cool-down-the-room-and-bed">Air out and cool down the room and bed</h3>

<p>Sleep is much better if the room temperature is slightly lower than what we’re used to. This is why it’s harder to fall asleep in the heat of summer. Just be careful not to overdo it and catch a cold.</p>

<h3 id="dont-drink-coffee-black-or-green-tea">Don’t drink coffee, black or green tea</h3>

<p>If you drink coffee, have your last cup by 4:00 PM at the latest, ideally no later than 2:00 PM. In the evening, it’s better not to drink regular tea either; opt for chamomile tea instead.</p>

<h3 id="relax">Relax</h3>

<p>When you lie down, listen to your body, check if there’s any tension. Mentally go through your muscles and try to relax them. Then take a deep breath, hold it for a second, and as you exhale, try to relax the muscles in your chest, abdomen, and back.</p>
