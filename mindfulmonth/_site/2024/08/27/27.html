<h2 id="write-down-activities-that-bring-joy-and-dont">Write down activities that bring joy and don’t</h2>

<p>To constantly keep up with everything and solve complex tasks, you need a lot of energy. And this is not just the energy that we replenish with sleep.</p>

<p>Some activities fill us up — after such activities, you feel joy, uplift, a surge of energy. It can be anything — time with friends or family, playing Civilization, a favorite sport, reading books about evolution or gardening.</p>

<p>And there are activities that drain energy — after them, you feel emotionally drained.</p>

<p>Take a sheet of paper and a pen. Divide the sheet into two halves: in the first, list the activities that bring joy, inspire you, and that you’re willing to do just for the sake of it. In the second — those that drain energy.</p>

<p>You don’t need to organize them or write them in order of priority. Just write down everything you remember.</p>

<p>Look at the list of unpleasant activities. Think about what needs to be done to engage in them less often or not spend so much energy on them.</p>

<p>Look at the list of pleasant activities. How often do you engage in them? What prevents you from doing them more often?</p>

<p>You don’t necessarily have to start changing anything right now. It’s good if you just know about these two lists.</p>
