It fits for public schools in Russia that were forced to switch to the distant format because of COVID-19. </p><p>I left the company just in the moment Class was launched. So I can&#x27;t show the number of users and some metrics. But I want to show a process of design, research, and a bit of the handoff process.</p><p>I joined the project almost at the very beginning. There were 2 people in the team: a product manager and a system analyst. They did some research and discovered the problem faced by school teachers during the remote educational process. Eventually, teachers had zoom and other tools for video calls, but there was another huge problem: how to gather and review the homework from students.</p><p>In Russia, there are a few services for online education, but they are really expensive for public schools and require a complete change in the educational process. So teachers tried to solve the problem themselves. Someone created groups with students on social networks or WhatsApp and send and received homework there. Someone did it via email. But almost every teacher said it was chaos. It took a long time to gather homework, remind students about it, and manage them.</p><p>The product manager had an idea to build a cheap product for public schools, which cost can vary on the number of teachers. In Russia, there are forty thousand public schools. As well, there is a possible future benefit to creating a paid version for students and parents (there are 15 million students in public schools).</p><p>So the manager came to me with an idea of the product: almost all teachers use messengers, therefore, we can make a messenger for teachers with a killer-feature that provides to review homework. In this messenger, teachers and students could communicate with each other during the educational process:</p><ol><li>A teacher sends a task to the students.</li><li>Students made homework, take a photo and send it to the teacher.</li><li>The teacher reviews the homework, adds comments, and gives a mark.</li></ol><p>I’ve studied the results of the research and highlighted one thing: teachers were complaining about messengers, but the team wanted to build another messenger. So I convince the team to validate this idea through user testing. I made an interactive prototype to test the most important user&#x27;s case: to check homework from students.</p><img src="https://kseniailinyh.github.io/portfolio/img/12e11428-d699-4202-8245-2ceac1a0fa20.png" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto"></img><div></div><p></p><p>The product manager conducted user testing, and I was an observer. Our responders had some difficulties during user testing and I noticed what teachers told about their usual offline process of the homework review. They always gather the homework from all students and then review them one after another.</p><p>At that moment I realized that the UI must be similar. It has to be not a messenger (but, of course, with a possibility to chat with students), it has to be a UI for managing homework from all students. So I prepared a low-fidelity prototype and presented it to the team.</p><img src="https://kseniailinyh.github.io/portfolio/img/56870c28-2562-40be-aa48-564dcbe37d7d.png" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto"></img><div></div><p></p><p>The team agreed and then I started user testing. All teachers passed the task and said that this is more convenient than just a messenger because it allows monitoring how many students pass the homework, and how many have not yet.</p><p>The general task was to launch MVP as soon as possible and validate it in a few public schools. We started May 2021 and wanted to launch the first version before the new school year which starts in September. So I start designing an MVP.</p><p>There were a lot of prototypes for both students and teachers. Students work on a mobile web interface, which allows them to get the homework, make it on a paper, take a photo and send it to the teacher for review. </p><img src="https://kseniailinyh.github.io/portfolio/img/5221014a-54c6-4cc4-be9c-1fa892301e3d.png" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto"></img><div></div><p></p><p>Teachers get homework from students in the web interface, review them, leave comments and notes, and give marks. There is also a chat with students, homework designer, and much more.</p><img src="https://kseniailinyh.github.io/portfolio/img/ac50890b-b731-46b0-9ab1-bbda2775df82.png" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto"></img><div></div><p></p><p>And besides, I want to show my approach for design handoff in the case of limited time. I love to communicate with engineers and understand that often some obvious things for me are not obvious to them. For this reason, I always try to make design documentation as detailed as possible.</p><p>We had weekly meetings, in which I usually presented a design. But it is not always possible to show all the states and discuss all the details during the meeting. And this is why I prepared comprehensive design documentation with all possible states for every part of the interface. I tried to tell a story from every issue and show all possible states. For example, for one feature I tell a story about a boy Kolya who got low marks.</p><img src="https://kseniailinyh.github.io/portfolio/img/70f7123a-86de-4de1-8090-fd5e96dc0ed4.png" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto"></img><div></div><p></p><p>Sometimes I had not enough time for this design documentation and then I recorded short videos with explanations. The team was pleased and even called me a YouTube blogger.</p><img src="https://kseniailinyh.github.io/portfolio/img/227e8d00-33ca-4363-9453-8e327caa649b.gif" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto"></img><div></div><p></p><p>It allows me to save time and not discuss all the design details in meetings. Engineers didn’t waste time wondering how something must work and why exactly this way.</p><p>I left the company last September and Class has just been launched. As far as I can know, they tested successfully but realized that there are some government requirements. Now the team researching how to solve them.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p></div></body></html>
