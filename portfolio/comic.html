In Russia, it is a big directory with multiple levels of hierarchy. There are a lot of connectedness and relationships between levels. And all these relations must be shown in the interface. So I prepared a detailed description - it was a document with more than 10 pages.</p><p>Later I discussed the task with a backend developer. He said that he doesn&#x27;t read task descriptions because they are boring. I didn&#x27;t get was he serious or not, but said &quot;Challenge accepted!&quot;.</p><p>So I used xkcd characters and drew a comic with him and me. In the comic, I tell him about the task with pictures. The developer was delighted and did everything right.</p><p>Storytelling works! It is more exciting to read a comic about a developer and designer than a drily technical description.</p><img src="https://kseniailinyh.github.io/portfolio/img/0bf9d448-aea1-447a-866d-8c9e7b9a7011.png" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto"></img><div></div><p></p><div class="home-link"><div class="page-link"><a href="../"">Back</a></div></div></div></body></html>
