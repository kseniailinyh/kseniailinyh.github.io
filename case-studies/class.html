	<p>Class is&nbsp;a&nbsp;platform for students and teachers which provides communication during the remote educational process. Class was created for public schools in&nbsp;Russia that were forced to&nbsp;switch to&nbsp;the distant format because of&nbsp;COVID-19.</p>

	<p>Public schools were not ready for distant format. Eventually, they got used to&nbsp;Zoom and other tools for video calls, but there was another huge problem: how to&nbsp;gather and review the homework from students.</p>

	<p>Class solves this problem. Students get homework &rarr; do&nbsp;it&nbsp;on&nbsp;paper &rarr; take pictures and send them to&nbsp;a&nbsp;teacher &rarr; the teacher reviews it&nbsp;and gives a&nbsp;mark.</p>

	<p>I&nbsp;built the&nbsp;UI from scratch. There is&nbsp;a&nbsp;mobile web interface for students:</p>

	<p>Also, there is&nbsp;a&nbsp;desktop web interface for teachers. The first idea was to&nbsp;build a&nbsp;messenger where teachers could chat with students:</p>

	<p>But, after studying the result of&nbsp;the research, I&nbsp;proposed a&nbsp;completely different idea for the teacher&#39;s UI. I&nbsp;convinced the team, and validated it&nbsp;through user testing.</p>

	<p>I&nbsp;designed the&nbsp;UI where the teacher can manage all the tasks, and review homework by&nbsp;all students one by&nbsp;one without switching between chats:</p>

	<p>The most significant part of&nbsp;the teacher&#39;s UI&nbsp;is&nbsp;a&nbsp;homework review:</p>

	<p>Here the teacher can zoom photos:</p>

	<p>And gives marks:</p>
