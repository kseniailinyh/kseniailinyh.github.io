    <p>
      At Kontur, a leading SaaS provider in Russia with over 70 product teams, I established a new design team called "Bureau". Our purpose was to provide part-time design support for product teams without dedicated designers.
    </p>
    
    <ul>
      <li>I built and led a team of 5 designers: hired, onboarded, and mentored them.</li>
      <li>In 2021, our team provided end-to-end design for 30 product teams.</li>
      <li>The success of my team inspired other roles - developers, QA, and project managers - to create similar teams. As a result, the company now has a flexible pool of specialists for any project.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      I developed a process for our team and explained how to collaborate with us. To do this, I wrote content, created designs, and with the help of a front-end engineer, built the website.<br><br>
