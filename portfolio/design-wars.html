There were 3 product designers including me and each time we designed a new version of the same components, such as inputs, buttons, combo boxes, etc. Once, I realized that there was a lot of inconsistency in my product, and I wanted to fix it.</p><p>I started to build a design system and involved other product designers in it. But design system is not only a Sketch library (Figma hasn&#x27;t existed yet), it is also a developer&#x27;s tools. So we needed help from our front-end engineers.</p><p>I was sure that almost every engineer loves Star Wars. And I came up with an idea to use one of the most popular opening crawl. I made a video for my colleagues to tell them what we want. With this video, I wanted to show them how important our task is. Front-end engineers were exciting and agreed to help. They chose the light side of the Force.</p><p></p><div class="video"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/e3u6S5-q0Sw?feature=oembed&rel=0&controls=0" frameborder="0" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-popups allow-top-navigation-by-user-activation allow-forms allow-same-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe></div><p></p><div class="home-link"><div class="page-link"><a href="../"">Back</a></div></div></div></body></html>
