<h2 id="talk-to-your-loved-one">Talk to your loved one</h2>

<p>Today’s healthy habit is about mindfulness and relationships between people.</p>

<p>When people don’t talk much to each other about what concerns them and keep it to themselves, “baggage” accumulates. This isn’t primarily about grievances or complaints. It’s important to talk about everything that concerns each of you and what you want to discuss. But often people don’t do this.</p>

<p>Choose a time during the day, about 10 minutes, to talk with someone close to you. This could be your spouse or another close person. At the chosen time, simply start a conversation. What exactly you start talking about isn’t very important: you can just start with the question “How are you?”, or share an impression about the day, or bring up your own topic. And then - see how it goes.</p>

<p>Such a conversation is also a mindfulness exercise; during it, you need to listen and hear this person and yourself. Try to understand both of you, simultaneously.</p>

<p>Don’t create expectations for the conversation - don’t wait for any specific result. It’s like in meditation: the process is important, in this case - the conversation itself.</p>

<p>At the end, “listen” to yourself - what do you feel? What was the feeling before the conversation?</p>
