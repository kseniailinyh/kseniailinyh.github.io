For such teams, I created a new design team ”Bureau”, in which designers work for several products at the same time.</p><p>I often received the same questions about how to work with our team. So I wrote down frequent asked questions and made a guide. I wrote texts, made a design, found illustrations, found a frontend engineer who helped to develop the website.</p><img src="https://kseniailinyh.github.io/portfolio/img/3cb187d4-ff27-46bc-a89d-1787beaae924.png" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto"></img><div></div><p>The guide is in company&#x27;s intranet, but I also made a copy on GitHub:</p><p><a href="https://kseniailinyh-github-io.translate.goog/bureau/?_x_tr_sl=ru&_x_tr_tl=en&_x_tr_hl=en&_x_tr_pto=wapp"">Design Bureau Guide</a>
