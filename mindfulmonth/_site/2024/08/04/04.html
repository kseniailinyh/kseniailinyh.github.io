<h2 id="consciously-eat-lunch">Consciously eat lunch</h2>

<p>Yesterday, we talked about how we can live ordinary moments more mindfully. This brings more enjoyment to life. Eating is an important part of it. You can do more than just fuel yourself; you can enjoy your food.</p>

<p>Today, try to enjoy your lunch. Don’t get distracted by your phone; it’s better to leave it at your workspace. Sit down to eat away from your colleagues. Focus on the food. Experience the taste, break it down into ingredients. Notice how the feeling of fullness arrives. When you finish eating, don’t rush to get up and leave. Spend a couple of minutes with yourself.</p>

<p>What do you feel?</p>
