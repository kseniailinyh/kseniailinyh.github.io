		<h2>Initiative</h2>
		<p>While there wasn&#39;t an&nbsp;established process for reviewing support cases in&nbsp;our company, I&nbsp;took the initiative to&nbsp;dive into them myself. I&nbsp;discovered a&nbsp;significant number of&nbsp;cases related to&nbsp;blocked accounts. Intrigued, I&nbsp;decided to&nbsp;investigate the login form&#39;s functionality.</p>

		<h2>The Issues</h2>
		<p>It&nbsp;turned out the login form was poorly designed:</p>
		<img src="login-form/login-form-01.png" alt="Issue 1 with initial login form">
		<img src="login-form/login-form-02.png" alt="Issue 2 with initial login form">
		<img src="login-form/login-form-03.png" alt="Issue 3 with initial login form">

		<ul>
			<li>It&nbsp;didn&#39;t warn users about account blocking after several failed attempts.</li>
			<li>The form didn&rsquo;t notify users when they were blocked; it&nbsp;only notifies users about blocking if&nbsp;they typed the correct password.</li>
			<li>The blocking lasts for 15&nbsp;minutes, but the form didn&rsquo;t warn users about&nbsp;it.</li>
			<li>The form didn&rsquo;t allow password resets if&nbsp;the account was blocked.</li>
		</ul>

		<p>These issues explained the high number of&nbsp;support requests. Moreover, there were error messages in&nbsp;different styles and with unclear wording.</p>

		<h2>Solution</h2>
		<p>While tempted to&nbsp;redesign the entire form (and&nbsp;I redesigned&nbsp;it, but only for the portfolio case, the original form looks less appealing), I&nbsp;realized that small, targeted changes would be&nbsp;more efficient and quicker for the development team to&nbsp;implement.</p>

		<p>I&nbsp;prioritized these changes based on&nbsp;their potential impact, drawing from my&nbsp;experience, and presented them to&nbsp;stakeholders.</p>

		<h2>Project Status</h2>

		<p>The project was approved and is&nbsp;currently in&nbsp;development.</p>

		<p>Although I&nbsp;can&rsquo;t present metrics yet, I&nbsp;plan to&nbsp;use the support case numbers as&nbsp;a&nbsp;baseline post-release. My&nbsp;hypothesis is&nbsp;that these small changes will enhance user experience providing clarity and transparency and, as&nbsp;a&nbsp;result, reduce support requests.</p>
