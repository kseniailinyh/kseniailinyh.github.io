<h2 id="leave-your-phone-computer-and-tablet-outside-the-bedroom">Leave your phone, computer, and tablet outside the bedroom</h2>

<p>Yesterday’s task was to go to bed an hour earlier, and we also shared several habits that positively affect sleep. Today, we’ll return to one of them.</p>

<p>To prevent phone and tablet use from reducing sleep quality, don’t bring them into the bedroom. And don’t bring your laptop either. It’s not just about melatonin production—an extra dose of information doesn’t help you sleep better either. When you mindlessly scroll through social media or read news before bed, you continue thinking about something, while you should be relaxing and going to sleep.</p>

<p>The start of your day will also be better—after waking up, you won’t be able to check notifications immediately. Instead, you can slowly come to your senses, have a “clear” head for at least a few minutes. Stretch, listen to your body, set your mood for the day—give yourself some time. This is the time for yourself that you might have been missing.</p>

<p>If your devices charge in the bedroom, move the chargers to another room and leave the devices there overnight.</p>

<p>If you wake up to an alarm on your phone, this time set the alarm louder, and then—buy a separate alarm clock.</p>

<p>If you want, you can develop this practice and not touch your devices until you leave the house. You’ll learn about all emails once you’re at work, and you’ll spend your morning here and now.</p>
