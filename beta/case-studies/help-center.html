			<a href="https://kontur-inc.com/">Kontur</a> is&nbsp;a&nbsp;B2B software company making 70&nbsp;online services for 2&nbsp;million businesses in&nbsp;Russia. Many product teams use Help Center&nbsp;&mdash; a&nbsp;universal tool for communication between clients and technical support, like Intercom. It&nbsp;consists of&nbsp;a&nbsp;messenger, contacts, ordering a&nbsp;callback, etc.
		</p>

		<h3>Problems</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Low percent of&nbsp;chats instead of&nbsp;phone calls. Support via phone is&nbsp;much more expensive than via chat.</li>
			<li>Outdated design. And so&nbsp;some product teams often refused to&nbsp;use Help Center.</li>
		</ul>

		<p>Old design of&nbsp;Help Center:</p>

		<p>My&nbsp;role was as&nbsp;an&nbsp;art director, and the designer was Ksenia Kokorina, Sergei Semin helped&nbsp;us with conceptual designs. We&nbsp;made some research and found references. I&nbsp;proposed the concept:</p>

		<ul>
			<li>Highlight the messenger and make it&nbsp;the main thing in&nbsp;this tool.</li>
			<li>Tidy up&nbsp;other tools and links and make them less significant.</li>
			<li>Add customization for brand colors of&nbsp;the products.</li>
		</ul>

		<p>First drafts:</p>

		<p>Also, I&nbsp;took into account the stages of&nbsp;implementation. Firstly, for taking care of&nbsp;users and not to&nbsp;shock them, and secondly, to&nbsp;make it&nbsp;easier for development:</p>

		<p>To&nbsp;promote the Help Center among the products, I&nbsp;gathered all the 50&nbsp;designers, told them about the current problems of&nbsp;the widget, presented our concept and the final design. Designers were inspired, many wanted to&nbsp;use the new Help Center.</p>
		<p>Before and After:</p>

		<img src="help-center/help-center-04.png" alt="Before and after of the Help Center redesign">

		<p>In&nbsp;2021, the widget was opened by&nbsp;1.7 million users. Questions handled with the messenger increased from&nbsp;15% to&nbsp;45% after the redesign.</p>
