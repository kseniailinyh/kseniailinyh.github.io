<h2 id="thank-yourself">Thank yourself</h2>

<p>The other day we wrote about activities that energize us and about dreams. It’s important not only to work and cultivate good habits, but also to love yourself. This is what the last task is dedicated to.</p>

<p>Thank yourself. For completing some tasks, or for good work, or for something else significant, or just because.</p>

<p>Perhaps there’s something you’ve wanted for a long time, or you’ve been dreaming of trying a new restaurant, or attending a performance by your favorite artist. Something you’ve wanted for a while but have been denying yourself. Reward yourself. And do this from time to time. Remember, you don’t need a reason to be kind to people. Including being kind to yourself.</p>
