<h2 id="write-down-the-three-most-important-things-for-today">Write down the three most important things for today</h2>

<p>Yesterday we talked about the importance of focusing on important tasks, rather than trying to do everything you once promised to do. Now let’s practice remembering what’s important in any given moment.</p>

<p>In the morning, before starting your workday, write down the 3 most important tasks for today. Write them on a sticky note and attach it to your monitor.</p>

<p>Once again:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Do this before you start working;</li>
  <li>There should be three tasks;</li>
  <li>These should be the most important tasks for today.</li>
</ol>

<p>You don’t have to complete all three tasks. You don’t even have to complete one of them. The assignment is simply to write them down and stick them in front of you. This is a very simple, magical productivity technique.</p>
