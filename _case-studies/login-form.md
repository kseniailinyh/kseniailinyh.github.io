## Users contact support after failed logins

Blocked accounts were among the top-5 reasons for support requests. Users didn’t understand why they couldn’t log in&nbsp;, they weren’t informed that their account was locked after several failed attempts or&nbsp;that it&nbsp;would automatically unlock after 15&nbsp;minutes. As&nbsp;a&nbsp;result, they repeatedly contacted support instead of&nbsp;simply waiting.

## I&nbsp;noticed the pattern and decided to&nbsp;investigate

There was no&nbsp;established process for reviewing support cases, so&nbsp;I&nbsp;took the initiative to&nbsp;explore them myself. I&nbsp;found that the login form was misleading – it&nbsp;didn’t clearly communicate what was happening or&nbsp;what users should do&nbsp;next.

## Instead of&nbsp;a&nbsp;big redesign, I&nbsp;focused on&nbsp;high-impact fixes

After discussing with developers, I&nbsp;realized that a&nbsp;full redesign would take too&nbsp;much time and resources. So&nbsp;instead, I&nbsp;focused on&nbsp;small, simple improvements with the highest potential impact. I&nbsp;prioritized these ideas, prepared visuals, and presented them to&nbsp;the product manager.

The proposal was approved and added to&nbsp;the development scope.

## Key improvements

- Added clear messages explaining why the account is&nbsp;locked and for how long  
- Allowed password reset even for locked accounts  
- Improved error wording and visual consistency

## Approved for development and ready to&nbsp;measure results

The project was approved for implementation. Once released, I&nbsp;plan to&nbsp;track its effect by&nbsp;comparing the number of&nbsp;related support cases. I&nbsp;expect these small changes to&nbsp;make the login process clearer and reduce unnecessary support load.

## Small initiative, real impact

This case shows how taking initiative and focusing on&nbsp;pragmatic UX improvements can meaningfully improve both user experience and business outcomes even without a&nbsp;full redesign.
