<h2 id="take-a-walk">Take a walk</h2>

<p>Go for a walk just because.</p>

<p>Not on your way to the store, but just go out for a walk. Not for 15 or 30 or 60 minutes, but for as long as you want.</p>

<p>Choose and set aside time for this.</p>

<p>At the appointed hour — get up and go.</p>

<p>During the walk, you don’t need to do anything special. If you want to be here and now and spend this time mindfully — be. If you want to think about a task that has been on your mind for a while — think. The main thing is to take a walk and be with yourself.</p>

<p>And yes, dress for the weather.</p>
