<h2 id="call-a-friend-or-relative-you-havent-talked-to-for-a-long-time">Call a friend or relative you haven’t talked to for a long time</h2>

<p>Sometimes we don’t communicate with loved ones due to everyday reasons, like moving to another city. Sometimes because of this, the connection begins to fade.</p>

<p>Choose a close person you haven’t talked to in a long time and give them a call. Just like that, without any particular reason. Don’t create any expectations beforehand.</p>

<p>It could be an old friend or a relative. Who exactly doesn’t matter, as long as you have pleasant feelings when you think about this person.</p>

<p>Don’t start the conversation with a blame game like “Why don’t you call or write?” or “Where have you been?”. Don’t be shy to say if you’re happy to hear them and have missed them.</p>
