<h2 id="leave-your-phone-at-home">Leave your phone at home</h2>

<p>Live one day without your phone. Leave it at home.</p>

<p>You won’t be constantly checking your phone and worrying about messages and notifications. You’ll have a much calmer day if you don’t immediately know that someone has messaged you.</p>

<p>You can respond to messages when you’re at your workplace, not all day long. Not in the car, not in the kitchen, not at a meeting, but only at your workplace. This is possible because most messages don’t require an immediate response. If you react in an hour instead of immediately, no one will die.</p>

<p>Try a “soft” option if you absolutely can’t be out of touch with your loved ones:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Turn off your phone for half a day and let people know you’ll be unavailable for some time;</li>
  <li>Turn off notifications on your phone. Keep calls, but only from people on your “Favorites” list.</li>
</ul>
