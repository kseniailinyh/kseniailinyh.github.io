I have worked in small and big product teams, in a start-up, and in an established product.</p><p>I love turning chaos into a simple-to-use interface that solves customer&#x27;s problems. </p><p>One of my superpowers is mischief: I love using funny and entertaining tricks in my everyday work. Once, I drew a comic with tasks details for the developer who didn&#x27;t like to read tasks descriptions: <a href="https://medium.com/designkontur/%D0%BE%D0%BF%D0%B8%D1%81%D0%B0%D1%82%D1%8C-%D0%B7%D0%B0%D0%B4%D0%B0%D1%87%D1%83-%D0%B2-%D0%B2%D0%B8%D0%B4%D0%B5-%D0%B8%D1%81%D1%82%D0%BE%D1%80%D0%B8%D0%B8-ca1f1d676536" target="_blank">https://medium.com/about-storytelling</a> (RU). And one day <a href="https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0*_r-vvaAkc8Afyoz_" target="_blank">I put Lumpy Space Princess</a> from the TV show &quot;Adventure Time&quot; into my prototypes. She helped me to diversify my routine task. </p><p>I am currently in Georgia, Batumi, GMT +4. I prefer remote work, but open to relocation.</p><h3>Cube Dev – Product Designer</h3><p>Oct 2021 - Jan 2022 · 4 months</p><p><a href="https://cube.dev/" target="_blank">Cube Dev</a> is a series A start-up that provides headless business intelligence for building analytics applications. The paid product is a <a href="https://cube.dev/cloud/" target="_blank">Cube Cloud</a>. </p><p>I became the first product designer in the product team and built the design process from the scratch:</p><ul><li>I have distinguished the design into a separate stage in the development process. </li><li>Organized and implemented a design-to-dev handoff process.</li><li>Together with a product manager, we prioritized the backlog, and defined the roadmap for design.</li></ul><p>I have dealt with a difficult domain of developer&#x27;s frameworks and non-trivial use cases. Was responsible for the end-to-end design.</p><h3>Kontur – Head of Design Bureau </h3><p>Nov 2019 - Sep 2021 · 1 yr 11 months</p><p><a href="https://kontur-inc.com/" target="_blank">Kontur</a> is a leader among SaaS providers in Russia in terms of revenue from sales in 2011–2018 with 2.2 million clients and more than 70 product teams, big and small.</p><p>Not every product team in Kontur needs a full-time product designer, but sometimes there is a part-time job for them. For such teams, I created a new design team ”Bureau”, in which designers work for several products at the same time.</p><ul><li>I raised Bureau to 5 designers: hired, onboarded, and mentored them. I assigned tasks according to the designer&#x27;s workload and communicated with product teams.</li><li>I shaped the whole process of communication with product teams – and created a guide on how to work with our team: <a href="https://kseniailinyh-github-io.translate.goog/bureau/?_x_tr_sl=ru&_x_tr_tl=en&_x_tr_hl=en&_x_tr_pto=wapp" target="_blank">https://kseniailinyh.github.io/bureau/</a></li><li>In 2021, 5 designers in Bureau provided end-to-end design for 30 product teams. 10 startups were launched without dedicated designers.</li><li>One of my biggest achievements is the creation of a friendly and supportive atmosphere between designers. For this purpose, I organized &quot;Design Games&quot; – monthly informal meetings in which we made an express redesign for some apps. Also, I gave a speech on how to give and get a feedback: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHFsnUXkSSk" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHFsnUXkSSk</a> (RU)</li></ul><p>Our team turned out to be a good example for other functions, so in 2021, the same teams for UX researchers, analysts, and developers have emerged.</p><h3>Kontur – Product Designer</h3><p>Dec 2012 - Sep 2021 · 8 yrs 10 months</p><ul><li>Helped to launch 3 new products designing interfaces from the scratch: a product <a href="https://kontur-ru.translate.goog/class?_x_tr_sl=ru&_x_tr_tl=en&_x_tr_hl=en&_x_tr_pto=wapp" target="_blank">for school teachers</a> (web and mobile UI), a product for small and midsize businesses to help them comply with GDPR-like regulations that has acquired more than 10,000 paying enterprise customers, and an internal CRM for programer’s job interview. </li><li>Launched more than 10 user testing: prepared interactive prototypes, recruited users, made more than 15 interviews.</li><li>Invented and organized a brand-new prototype testing process: together with my colleague, I created a website with an interactive prototype and a survey. We collected 300+ user feedback for 2 days. It was a few years before <a href="https://maze.co/" target="_blank">Maze</a> appeared. I gave a speech at it: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t_zKEjuiins" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t_zKEjuiins</a> (RU)</li></ul><div class="page-link"><span style="font-size: 1.2em; margin-right: 5px;">⚡</span><a href="https://kseniailinyh.github.io/portfolio/help-center" target="_blank">test</a></div></div></body></html>
