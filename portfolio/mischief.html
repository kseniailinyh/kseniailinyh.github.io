I&#x27;ve been working on B2B products for most of my career, so there often were not very exciting tasks. My funny tricks help me to bring joy into my everyday work.</p><h1>Design Wars </h1><p>In 2015, I was working on a product without a design system. There were 3 product designers including me and each time we designed a new version of the same components, such as inputs, buttons, combo boxes, etc. Once, I realized that there was a lot of inconsistency in my product, and I wanted to fix it.</p><p>I started to build a design system and involved other product designers in it. But design system is not only a Sketch library (Figma hasn&#x27;t existed yet), it is also a developer&#x27;s tools. So we needed help from our front-end engineers.</p><p>I was sure that almost every engineer loves Star Wars. And I came up with an idea to use one of the most popular opening crawl. I made a video for my colleagues to tell them what we want. With this video, I wanted to show them how important our task is. Front-end engineers were exciting and agreed to help. They chose the light side of the Force.</p><p></p><div class="video"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/e3u6S5-q0Sw?feature=oembed&rel=0&controls=0" frameborder="0" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-popups allow-top-navigation-by-user-activation allow-forms allow-same-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe></div><h1>Lumpy Space Princess</h1><p>Once, I&#x27;ve been working on a task with form validation. There were a lot of constraints so I needed to design more than 20 tooltips and write error messages. It was not a very exciting task.</p><p>But Lumpy Space Princess from the TV show &quot;Adventure Time&quot; helped me. On every screen, she told me about a constraint and how to turn it into a concise error message.</p><p>So she helped to diversify a boring task not only for me but also for an engineer who worked with me.</p><img src="https://kseniailinyh.github.io/portfolio/img/944993b9-da7d-4bee-a66d-d315f93e1b74.png" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto"></img><div></div><h1>Comic</h1><p>Once, I had the task of switching on a directory of addresses in my product. In Russia, it is a big directory with multiple levels of hierarchy. There are a lot of connectedness and relationships between levels. And all these relations must be shown in the interface. So I prepared a detailed description - it was a document with more than 10 pages.</p><p>Later I discussed the task with a backend developer. He said that he doesn&#x27;t read task descriptions because they are boring. I didn&#x27;t get was he serious or not, but said &quot;Challenge accepted!&quot;.</p><p>So I used xkcd characters and drew a comic with him and me. In the comic, I tell him about the task with pictures. The developer was delighted and did everything right.</p><p>Storytelling works! It is more exciting to read a comic about a developer and designer than a drily technical description.</p><img src="https://kseniailinyh.github.io/portfolio/img/a006d5ca-afe7-4ddf-87fb-95ac469af4bd.png" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto"></img><div></div></div></body></html>
