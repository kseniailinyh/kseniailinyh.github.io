<h2 id="ask-yourself-why-do-what-youre-doing">Ask yourself, why do what you’re doing</h2>

<p>“Why?” is a useful question.</p>

<p>It doesn’t matter how long you’ve been working at the company. It doesn’t matter what exactly you do. It doesn’t matter whether you’re carrying out assignments or choosing tasks. Before each new task, pause for a second and ask yourself: “Why am I doing this? What should change as a result of this?”</p>

<p>These questions will help you work mindfully and do exactly what needs to be done. They will help you achieve results and stay on track.</p>

<p>Ask these questions about your work tasks. Once you’ve answered them, start working.</p>

<p>And now, ask these questions about your personal matters.</p>
