At&nbsp;Kontur, a&nbsp;leading SaaS provider in&nbsp;Russia with over 70&nbsp;product teams, I&nbsp;established a&nbsp;new design team called &laquo;Bureau&raquo;. Our purpose was to&nbsp;provide part-time design support for product teams without dedicated designers.

- I&nbsp;built and led a&nbsp;team of&nbsp;5&nbsp;designers: hired, onboarded, and mentored them.
- In&nbsp;2021, our team provided end-to-end design for 30&nbsp;product teams.
- The success of&nbsp;my&nbsp;team inspired other roles&nbsp;&mdash; developers, QA, and project managers&nbsp;&mdash; to&nbsp;create similar teams. As&nbsp;a&nbsp;result, the company now has a&nbsp;flexible pool of&nbsp;specialists for any project.

I&nbsp;developed a&nbsp;process for our team and explained how to&nbsp;collaborate with&nbsp;us. To&nbsp;do&nbsp;this, I&nbsp;wrote content, created designs using free illustrations by&nbsp;Icons8, and with the help of&nbsp;a&nbsp;front-end engineer, built the website.<br><br>
